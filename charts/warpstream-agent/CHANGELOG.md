## [0.13.79] - 2025-01-24
- Update WarpStream Agent to v616.

## [0.13.78] - 2025-01-24
- Don't fall back to using a secret secret when `configMapEnabled` is set to false.
  - In the past, some deployment combinations would cause pods to not run due to missing secrets.
  - For example if `configMapEnabled` was false, and `config.apiKeySecretKeyRef` was used, the secret `{{ include "warpstream-agent.secretName" . }}` would not exist which would prevent pods from starting.
  - Users that were relying on this functionality should switch to `extraEnvFrom` that was added in `0.13.76`, as the previous functionaliy was not intended behavior.
- Document env variables that should be set if `configMapEnabled` is set to false
